Once in Paris we will go to our hotel called the Sublim Eiffel to check in. I have arranged for a bottle of sparkling wine to be placed in the room. On the first day we are going to visit the Eiffel Tower and I have booked us into the restaurant up the tower for dinner. On Sunday we’ll be going shopping and will visit the sites near to the Arc De Triomphe. Monday’s plans will be to go to the Louvre museum and spend some time walking and taking in the sites.
