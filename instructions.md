Informed consent 

(identical to the one already approved)

-------

In a previous study, we asked participants to either tell the truth or lie about their most important activity in the next 7 days.

-------

Your task in this study is to read some of these statements and to identify which ones are truthful and which are deceptive.

-------

normal (no ML input):

Please indicate your judgment as follows:

- below each statememt you will see a slider with values from 1 to 100
- use the slider to indicate how truthful or deceptive you think the statement is
- the slider is set by default to a neutral point of 50 (i.e. indecisive between truthful and deceptive)
- values on the left = you judge a statement to be more truthful
- values on the right = you judge the statement to be more deceptive
- the more you move the slider to the extremes, the more certainty you indicate with your judgment (i.e. values closer to the middle suggest that you are less certain of your judgment)

-------

fully flexible (ML input):

All statements that you are about to read were previously judged by an artificial intelligence (AI) programme.

We are interested in how human expertise (you) can be combined with artificially intelligent programmes in identifying truth-tellers and liars.

The AI was trained on a subset of statements and was then asked to judge the statements that you are about to read. For none of these statements was the AI aware whether they were truthful or not.


Please indicate your judgment as follows:

- below each statememt you will see a slider with values from 1 to 100
- use the slider to indicate how truthful or deceptive you think the statement is
- the slider is set by default to the AI's judgment
- adjust the AI judgment by moving the slider
- you can make use of the full range of values.
- values on the left = the statement is judged to be more truthful
- values on the right = the statement is judged to be more deceptive
- the more you move the slider to the extremes, the more certainty you indicate with your judgment (i.e. values closer to the middle suggest that you are less certain of your judgment)

partially flexible (ML input):

All statements that you are about to read were previously judged by an artificial intelligence (AI) programme.

We are interested in how human expertise (you) can be combined with artificially intelligent programmes in identifying truth-tellers and liars.

The AI was trained on a subset of statements and was then asked to judge the statements that you are about to read. For none of these statements was the AI aware whether they were truthful or not.


Please indicate your judgment as follows:

- below each statememt you will see a slider with values from 1 to 100
- use the slider to indicate how truthful or deceptive you think the statement is
- the slider is set by default to the AI's judgment
- adjust the AI judgment by moving the slider
- you are allowed to adjust the AI judgment up to 10 points to the left or right
- the green area shows you the allowed region in which you make a valid judgment
- values on the left = the statement is judged to be more truthful
- values on the right = the statement is judged to be more deceptive
- the more you move the slider to the extremes, the more certainty you indicate with your judgment (i.e. values closer to the middle suggest that you are less certain of your judgment)

--------

Reward: Deception detection is typically very difficult. Take your time in reading the statements and making your judgment.

In total, you will judge only 5 brief statements. 

We will pay you 25p extra as a bonus per statement if you make the judgment more accurate.

This means you can earn an additional GBP 1.25 for performing well on this task.

------
(manipulation check before the task)

As a check: What are your task instructions?

- estimate the truthfulness/deception of statements with a slider
- adjust a previous AI judgment with a slider by max. plus/minus 10 points
- adjust a previous AI judgment using the full range of values

(back to instr. if wrong)

-------

We start with two practice statements.

-------

Practice 1:

Adjust the slider value to indicate a highly deceptive judgment.

-------

Practice 2:

Adjust the slider value to indicate a highly truthful judgment.

-------

(here comes the actual task)

5 statements per participant

conditions (normal, fully flexible, partially flexible) s between-subjects factor

-------

We're interested to learn from your strategy in making a truth vs lie decision.

How did you make the judgment on the five statements you just rated?
