In a previous study, we asked participants to either tell the truth or lie about their most important activity in the next 7 days.

-----------

Your task in this study is to read some of these statements and to identify which ones are truthful and which are deceptive.

-------

normal:

Please indicate your judgment as follows:

- below each statememt you will see a slider with values from 1 to 100
- use the slider to indicate how truthful or deceptive you think the statement is
- values on the left side indicate that you judge a statement to be more truthful, while values on the right indicate that you judge the statement to be more deceptive
- use the slider to include how certain you are with your decision (i.e. values closer to the middle suggest that you are less certain of your judgment)

-------

fully flexible:

All statements that you are about to read were previously judged by an artificial intelligence (AI) programme.

We are interested in how human expertise (you) can be combined with artificially intelligent programmes in identifying truth-tellers and liars.

The AI was trained on a subset of statements and was then asked to judge the statements that you are about to read. For none of these statements was the AI aware whether they were truthful or not.


Please indicate your judgment as follows:

- below each statememt you will see a slider with values from 1 to 100
- the slider shows you the AI's judgment
- use the slider to indicate how truthful or deceptive you think the statement is
- You can make use of the full range of values.
- values on the left side indicate that you judge a statement to be more truthful, while values on the right indicate that you judge the statement to be more deceptive
- use the slider to include how certain you are with your decision (i.e. values closer to the middle suggest that you are less certain of your judgment)

Please indicate your judgment as follows:

- below each statememt you will see a slider with values from 1 to 100
- the slider shows you the AI's judgment
- you are allowed to adjust the AI judgment up to 10 points above/below
- the green area shows you the region in which you can adjust the AI judgment if you want to
- values on the left side indicate that you judge a statement to be more truthful, while values on the right indicate that you judge the statement to be more deceptive
- use the slider to include how certain you are with your decision (i.e. values closer to the middle suggest that you are less certain of your judgment)

Reward: deception detection is typically very difficult. Take your time in reading the statements and making your judgment.

In total, you will judge only 5 brief statements. 

For each correct judgment that you make, we will pay you 25p extra. This means you can earn an additional GBP 1.25 for performing well on this task.

Manip check:

As a check:

What are your task instructions?

- estimate the truthfulness/deception of statements with a slider
- adjust a previous AI judgment with a slider by max. plus/minus 10 points
- adjust a previous AI judgment using the full range of values

Back if wrong.

-------

We start with two practice statements.

-------

Practice 1:

Adjust the slider value to indicate a highly deceptive judgment.
